### every heart knows the destiny and purpose of its owner in this world. The one who listens and follows it, achive the most noble life
#### @ conflicts with :
 - until you wake up a fool, it's mind will take to something called destiny
 - our thoughts become actions, actions become outcome, which becomes the future
 - you are solely responsible for the future
   
It's crazy that destiny exists and doesn't exists at the same time. Everyone says destiny is a things, but some say it is decided by our thoughts and that we define destiny. *And yet we see both types of life*


### Everything is a essence of a pure all-powerful, all-self-knowing entity. Whoever learns the language of it, can achive anything
