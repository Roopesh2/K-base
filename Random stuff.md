For the entirety time,.. i always heard people taking about me. But strangely, never giving me a chance to tell the true story.
Ironically when it comes to me a lot of them  (or may be all of them ) gets wrong about me.
A generous helper who's always available.. some might say. And most people think I love helping people. And a rare fraction think I'm just another crackhead who became popular for no reason. Whatever that is it's hard to generalise me.
And there's some friends who think they can generalise my behaviour and possibly _predict_ them out of thin air. (Now that is quite interesting)
Whatever it is, one thing that I'm sure is, you really don't know who I am (and possibly you'll never). For some reason idk, I was disastrously introvert. Never liked company of people (let alone helping others). I Always been a keen silent explorer of world around me and the ones that probably exists within few inches.
And interruptions? Absolutely hate it!
Now thats all the stories of few years ago. Nowadays everything has changed. In just a year. It's quite bizzare. Hard to explain.. how i got here. 
I thought this is good. Im atleast socializing with people. Making new connections. And expanding my understanding of others. This year taught me a lot about people. Their diversity. And probably making a lot of  hypothesis of which some evolves to theories. And these are the theories which guides us. Which shapes our social lenses - how, when and to whom we connect, we present, we express. 
And that realisation made me a tolerant to a wide variety of stupidities. 

In all of these times, somehow i began losing my personality. Altering them in some disastrous way. And the result? Dissatisfaction. 
I didn't realised this at the beginning. I always wondered why I don't feel contented when helping others even though it gave me some short term pleasure. Sometimes thinking "am I anhedonic?" "Do i miss something?" Or is there any deep problem within me?
I tried changing my behaviour, often illegal adjusting to others. And they were contented. They had a positive image. But I don't had a proper evaluator. So often i thought many things. Do I have bias towards certain people? And there were. So I wasted more time Correcting the _wrong_ bias. 
But as the time progressed i slowly began realising things.
Im actually secretly selfish. What I'm expecting in return? Gratitude of others. Their company. Even though a real helper shouldn't expect these (or they're n't really helping)
Most of my dissatisfaction came from this thing.
And it's been too late to realise it. School life was just a month away to finish. Thereafter went silent. Hiding from others. And subconsciously, craving anonymity. 
Symptoms slowly appeared in my conversation, attitude and eventually in my social media usage. I repeated got having intrusive thoughts of deleting Snapchat. Just pondering why I need it anyway. Sometimes Instagram, cause there.. everyone is sharing perfection.
My WhatsApp profile grew more creepy. 
Sometimes lamenting not to chat with those good old _best friends_ whom I used to play wholesome pranks, jokes, gratitude, stupidity....
Eventually i understood. I wasn't happy. Because.. I was trying to be something else. And it took long to find it, because I wasn't trying to be someone else irl.
And eventually i found, I had identity crisis.
Lost in deep sea of nothingness. Thrown by everyone, subconsciously.
Im.. literally just a 16yr old stupid who paradoxically did academy well. A crackhead. A bitch! Tbh. Im really incompatible with others. & To this society. 
Now it's time to be that old one. An explorer, diy-ist, and more important, a fuck-dont care-er.  Now I've been somewhat contented. Now I no longer think about people, places or events. I just keep an archive of everything. Just for a fun. I began working on some projects. And everything is going well. I no longer use Snapchat , Instagram, Twitter, and even YouTube. I joined reddit - a place where strangers join to share knowledge and puns. It's amazing place. No shitposting, no perfectionism. Just discussions, sharing knowledge and having fun.
People don't care about your help, your contributions. They just want to be happy. And my final words are:
> Don't be a fucking fool! Wasting energy to please others. Enjoy your life. You'll definitely have something to enjoy alone.
